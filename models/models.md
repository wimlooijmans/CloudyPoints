# Models
To start working on the project, one family of MDE models is selected namely MiDaS. 
## dpt_hybrid_384
This hybrid models uses a transformer and combines between medium accuracy and a medium inference speed. It uses input images with H=W=384.\
It contains 122M parameters.

## midas_v21_small_256
This model is smaller and is considered as a convulutional model. It has a higher inference speed but the accuracy is worst. It uses input images with H=W=256\
It contains 21.3M parameters.
