# CloudyPoints
CloudyPoints  - Machine Learning Systems Design Project. 

## Description 
CloudyPoints is a project where we'll work on Moncular Depth Estimation (MDE) and 3D Point Cloud Generation. The noun is inspired from the second part of the project. First, we need to know what is MDE. MDE is the task of predicting the depth of each pixel in an image using only a single RGB image (rather than stereo or LiDAR). The goal is to infer the 3D structure of a scene from a 2D image (using 3D point cloud).
This task is super important in real life like in Autonoumous systems (Collision avoidance, ...)  and video surveillance.
